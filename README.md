## Basic PASCAL Interpreter

This repo serves as the process of developing a basic pascal interpreter, which is the first part in creating a complete Zero Knowledge Compiler from scratch. For now all the code will be written in python and then I will add probably make an interpreter for the same or different language in **Rust** as well.

#### 1. calc1

Wrote a basic interpreter, it can do addition for single digits only and does not support whitespaces.

#### 2. calc2

Same as calc1 but supports subtraction, multiple digits and whitespaces as well.
